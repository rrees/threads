# Vivo Ultra III Bloom

These claim to be [the first shoes to be made from algae](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/mens/off-road/ultra-3-bloom-mens). I originally saw the Finisterre version of them and thought they looked cool and practical as beach wear, however that edition sold out in seconds.

This is Vivo's own take on the idea and is pretty similar apart from the colour. The shoes have a minimal feel with a mesh that is cool but also makes it easy to walk through the water while protecting your toes.

On a beach the sand pours through the holes and because the toe is piles at the front of the shoe, actually making it quite difficult to walk.

On pebbles, rough shoreline and harbour concrete the shoe was exactly as promised. A feeling akin to be being barefoot while protecting your feet from the heat and sharp edges.
