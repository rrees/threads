# Po-Zu Brisk shoes

[Po-Zu](http://po-zu.com) is a UK shoe designer who manufacturers their shoes in Portugal. Their Brisk sneaker comes in a variety of contrasting two-tone colours, I choose [black and green](http://po-zu.com/collections/mens/products/brisk-black-green).

## Returns

I initially ordered a size too small for me due to odd-sized feet and having to guess whether the sizing was generous or not (the sizes are exactly as advertised so one shoe fit and the other was a little cramped). The return process was pretty straight-forward with an email to get a return code (as well as a reservation for the right size) that you print out and attach to the original packaging.

From there I could use a Collect+ location to return the package. I received an email when the shoes arrived back and the replacements arrived promptly, just as the original order had.

The process felt painless and straight-forward and made me more confident about being more adventurous with my purchasing.
