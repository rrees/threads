# Finisterre zipped hoodie

I needed to replace a big comfortable hoodie that I use for travelling, after many years the fabric is starting to go.

Also after buying the Molly Crabapple Troy hoodie (sadly limited edition) for work I was interested in getting a zipped hoodie rather than the pouch pocket single piece one that I currently have.

[Finisterre](http://www.finisterreuk.com/) design clothing from a context of cold-water surfing.

## 2018 update

Despite shedding a lot initially the hoodie actually lasted really well. The first thing to go were the pockets which developed holes and then the surface began to bobble up. The colour also faded quite badly around the cuffs and unevenly across the rest of the surface.

However for three years it was probably my favourite hoodie.
