I needed to replace a big comfortable hoodie that I use for travelling, after many years the fabric is starting to go.

Also after buying the Molly Crabapple Troy hoodie (sadly limited edition) for work I was interested in getting a zipped hoodie rather than the pouch pocket single piece one that I currently have.

[Finisterre](http://www.finisterreuk.com/) are clothing coming out of cold-water surfing.
